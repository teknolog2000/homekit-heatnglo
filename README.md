# Fireplace #

This documents the Fireplace HomeKit adapter I built for myself. It is based on the [HAP-Node JS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) implementation and runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

# Dev environment

`> docker-compose exec node-devel bash`

`>  docker-compose run test` or inside the container `npm test`.
